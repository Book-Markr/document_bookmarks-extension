# Document Bookmarks: a chrome extension (**#WIP**)
*__A chrome browser extension that helps you to manage your bookmarks better__*

## Why
Currently, the way Chrome allows people to interface with their bookmarks is not really effective for a Bookmarks Power-User:

* __No option to add comments__
  Sometimes, it can get really difficult to remember the exact reason or motivation behind a bookmark. Sure, the title does a pretty good job at explaining what the page contains, but not why you found the contents helpful or what you feared losing had you not saved its link.  
  Also, comments can help store your personal views and your personal reflections about a page.

* __Difficult to share with people__
  By share, I mean even a simple copy-paste action is absurdly difficult with the bookmarks-
  1. You select the bookmark
  2. You right click and select the *Edit* option
  3. Then you select the title, copy-paste at a desired location
  4. Then you select the link, copy-paste at a desired location
  5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each bookmark that you want to share

* __Difficult to edit__
  A simple action like editing a bookmark requires you to right click on the respective bookmarks and select the *Edit* option from there before you can move on to actually editing it. That, in my opinion, introduces an unnecessary step to do such an elementary operation like editing a bookmark.

## How does Document Bookmarks help?

1. __Built-in option to add comment in the popup itself__
2. __Simple text based rendering of the bookmarks which can be easily copied like text on any other webpage__
3. __One-click to move to editing mode in a bookmark__

## How to install and use
Right now, this extension is a **Work in progress**. So, you won't be able to find it in the Chrome webstore.  
But don't worry, you can still install it and try it out easily:

* Step 1. Get the repository
	1. Go to this repository's [Home Page](https://github.com/nityeshaga/document_bookmarks-extension).
	2. Select the **Clone or download** option (present in a green box on the page).
	3. Click on **Download ZIP** (or Clone it if you know how).
	4. If you selected the **Download ZIP** option in the above step, you will now need to extract the contents in a suitable folder of your wish.

* Step 2. Install the extension in Chrome
	1. Open your Chrome browser.
	2. Select the **Options** menu (the three `.`s on the upper right corner).
	3. Go `More Tools` -> `Extensions`.
	4. Toggle the `Developer Mode` option to *On*.
	5. Select `Load Unpacked` and select the folder where you saved the download (in Step 1.4).

* Step 3. Use it
	1. You should see a new icon added to the right hand side of a Address bar in Chrome.
	2. Click it to save the bookmark to a desired folder and add comment.
	   (*Short aside on the Folder option:* You can enter just a folder name, or its full path using `/` as separator or even a partial path! The extension will find the right folder for you if it exists)
	3. If you go to **Bookmark Manager** (**Options** -> **Bookmarks** -> **Bookmarks Manager**), you will see a new design for the manager.
	   Here you can view all your bookmarks, edit existing bookmarks with one click, delete bookmarks (select the checkbox and press `d`/`D`.
	4. **Star this repository if you find it useful :)**
	5. Please raise an issue if you find something wrong or if you want to add some new feature. Also, it would be awesome if you could review the code, give me your opinion, tell me how to improve or better yet, contribute some code yourself!
